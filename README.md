# Word Masters

### How to Play:
- There is a secret five letter word chosen
- Players have six guesses to figure out the secret word. - After six guesses, they lose
- If the player guesses a letter that is in the right place, it is shown as green
- If the player guesses a letter that is in the word but not in the right place, it is shown as yellow
- It does account for however many of the letter exist in the word. For example, if the player guesses "SPOOL" and the word is "OVERT", one "O" is shown as yellow and the second one is not.
- If the player guesses the right word, the player wins and the game is over.
